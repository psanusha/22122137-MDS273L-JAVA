This is a menu-driven program that allows the user to enter, search, remove, and show all names in an array. The program uses a do-while loop and switch-case statements to provide the menu options.

Menu Options:
Enter a name: Allows the user to enter a unique name to add to the array.
Search for a name: Allows the user to search for a name in the array.
Remove a name: Allows the user to remove a name from the array.
Show all names: Displays all the unique names in the array.

Constraints:
The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
The names in the array should be unique; no duplicate entries are expected!
The program provides necessary validations to ensure that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
Removing a name does not create empty space inside the array.
